## What am I looking at?
This is the repo for my portfolio gh-page! I am big into digital art; 
photography, photo manipulation, music production, graphic design, etc.
I plan to use this as my home base for posting my projects with big
plans to be discussed below!

## How do I navigate around?
The goal of this site was to mimic a terminal interface, so the following
commands are available for you to use!
    help : for if you ever get confused and want a quick reference
    about : project explanation
    clear : reset your terminal
    ls : list directories (sub-pages)
    cd : change directory (switch to sub-page)
